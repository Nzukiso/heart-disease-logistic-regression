# Predicting Heart Disease using Logistic Regression  

This project investigates the predictive power of logistic regression on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.  
It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with model training and evaluation, reporting an accuracy of ~76% and sensitivity of 82%.  

## Key Highlights
- Performed data cleaning, pre-processing, and visualisation.  
- Conducted exploratory analysis of demographic and clinical variables.  
- Trained and evaluated a logistic regression model (scikit-learn).  
- Reported precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.  
- Discussed clinical implications, limitations, and future directions.  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Results
- Accuracy: 75.8%  
- Sensitivity (Recall): 82%  
- Specificity: 68%
