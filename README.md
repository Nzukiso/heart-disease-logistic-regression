# Predicting Heart Disease using Logistic Regression   

# Dataset Description: Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset  

This project uses the [Cleveland Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
It contains **303 patient records** with **14 attributes** (clinical, demographic, and diagnostic variables).  
The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease (*target* variable).  

---

## Variables  

- **age**: Age of the individual (years).  
- **sex**: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female).  
- **cp (chest pain type)**:  
  - 0 = Typical angina (all criteria present)  
  - 1 = Atypical angina (two of three criteria satisfied)  
  - 2 = Non-anginal pain (less than one criterion satisfied)  
  - 3 = Asymptomatic (no criteria satisfied)  

- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure on admission (mmHg).  
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol level (mg/dL).  
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (1 = true, 0 = false).  
- **restecg (resting ECG results)**:  
  - 0 = Normal  
  - 1 = ST-T wave abnormality (T-wave inversions and/or ST elevation/depression > 0.05 mV)  
  - 2 = Probable/definite left ventricular hypertrophy (Estes' criteria)  

- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved.  
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).  
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (in mm).  
- **slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment:  
  - 0 = Upsloping  
  - 1 = Flat  
  - 2 = Downsloping  

- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by fluoroscopy.  
- **thal (thalassemia)**:  
  - 1 = Normal  
  - 2 = Fixed defect  
  - 3 = Reversible defect  

- **target**: Presence of heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease).

## Notes  
- This dataset is widely used in medical ML studies for benchmarking.  
- Missing values have been handled in the original UCI dataset.

This project investigates the predictive power of logistic regression on the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.  
It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with model training and evaluation, reporting an accuracy of ~76% and sensitivity of 82%.  

## Key Highlights
- Performed data cleaning, pre-processing, and visualisation.  
- Conducted exploratory analysis of demographic and clinical variables.  
- Trained and evaluated a logistic regression model (scikit-learn).  
- Reported precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.  
- Discussed clinical implications, limitations, and future directions.  

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Results
- Accuracy: 75.8%  
- Sensitivity (Recall): 82%  
- Specificity: 68%
